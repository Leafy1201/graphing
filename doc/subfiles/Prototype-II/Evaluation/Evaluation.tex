Criteria                                                                                          & Achieved?             & Comments                                                                                                                                  \\ \hline
Plots Polynomials, Exponentials and Rational Functions.                                           & \cmark & As tested in prototype 1 it draws all the functions listed and some more.                                                                 \\ \hline
The accuracy of plotting function should be comparable to other graphing programs such as Desmos. & \cmark & The accuracy was as best as it could be with the only faults due to the programming language that I used and not due to my algorithms.                                 \\ \hline
The control of the viewport should be responsive.                                                 & \cmark & I asked Matthew, the stakeholder who asked for there to be more emphasis on this criteria, if I had achieved it and he said yes.          \\ \hline
There are no major experience affecting bugs in the software.                                     & \cmark & With myself and all my stakeholders using the program, there has been over 10 hours of use and there were been no crashes in any of them. \\ \hline
The software should be able to run on most hardware since at least 7 years ago.                   & \cmark & I tested this program on a very old computer and it worked great, however it struggled a bit when trying to draw 15 functions at once.    \\ \hline
