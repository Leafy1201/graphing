The requirements defined at the end of prototype 1 can be split them up into 2 distinct sections:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User Input
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let the user input functions
	\item Show/Hide functions (suggestion from a stakeholder)
	\end{itemize}
\item User Interaction
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Zoom in/out of the graph
	\item Pan around the graph
	\item Save plots as pictures
	\item Show coordinates in top left of pane (suggestion from a stakeholder)
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{enumerate}
The first section appears deceptively small however it is probably the most complicated part of the program. It needs to be simple to use and it will probably be the most difficult part to debug.
