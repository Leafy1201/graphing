\section{Layers}
As described in the design section, I will create classes that inherit from one a top class that I will call \texttt{Layer}. This class will be \texttt{abstract} since we will never instantiate this class and only inherit from it. The \texttt{CartesianLayer} will be a child class to the abstract \texttt{Layer} class. Again this will be \texttt{abstract} since we will only inherit from it. While it seems redundant for the super class \texttt{Layer} to exist, it fulfills the purpose of being able to create an array of type \texttt{Layer} which can then be filled with objects that are of types which are child classes to \texttt{Layer}. Our first instantiated class will be a child class to \texttt{CartesianLayer} and will be called \texttt{ExplicitXFunctionCartesianLayer}. The \texttt{X} signifies that the parameter will be $x$. Likewise we will have a class called \texttt{ExplicitYFunctionCartesianLayer}, where this will be a function in terms of $y$. Our \texttt{AxesLayer} will inherit from the \texttt{Layer} parent class. A diagram of this inheritance is shown below:
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{forest}
  for tree={
    align=center,
    parent anchor=south,
    child anchor=north,
    font=\sffamily,
    edge={thick, -{Stealth[]}},
    l sep+=10pt,
    edge path={
      \noexpand\path [draw, \forestoption{edge}] (!u.parent anchor) -- +(0,-10pt) -| (.child anchor)\forestoption{edge label};
    },
    if level=0{
      inner xsep=0pt,
      tikz={\draw [thick] (.south east) -- (.south west);}
    }{}
  }
  [Layer
    [CartesianLayer
      [ExplicitXFunctionCartesianLayer]
      [ExplicitYFunctionCartesianLayer]
      ]
    [AxesLayer]
    ]
  ]
\end{forest}
\end{center}

The problem with this part of the program is that everything is interdependent on everything else. Specifically here the \texttt{PlotPane} class is used within the \texttt{Layer} classes and vice versa. Since I will implement the \texttt{Layer} classes first I will create a bare bones  \texttt{PlotPane} class that just contains its attributes for use within the \texttt{Layer} classes and implement the \texttt{PlotPane} class later.
