\subsection{Create the Abstract Syntax Tree}
I first implemented the normal sequential function and later I will implement the multi-threaded approach. Again like the methods before it this is a static function, since it relates to the class not the object itself.
\begin{minted}[
frame=lines,
framesep=2mm,
linenos,
breaklines
]{java}
// create the abstract syntax tree for the expression - single-threaded
private static BinaryTree createTree(String expression) throws UnequalBracketsException {
	// remove enclosing matching brackets
	expression = checkBracket(expression);
	// find the least significant operator, if an operator remains
	int leastSigOperatorPos = leastSigOperatorPos(expression);
	if (leastSigOperatorPos == -1) { // base case - no operators remain
		return new BinaryTree(expression);
	} else { // recursive case - recurse on the sub-expressions
		// locate and hold the operator
		String operator = String.valueOf(expression.charAt(leastSigOperatorPos));
		// split the expression into sub-expressions by the operator and recurse on them
		String a = expression.substring(0, leastSigOperatorPos);
		String b = expression.substring(leastSigOperatorPos + 1);
		// return the new tree containing the trees of the sub-expressions and the
		// operator as the root value
		return new BinaryTree(operator, createTree(a), createTree(b));
	}
}
\end{minted}
The problem with creating a tree is that I can't actually display it in a way to check if my algorithm works. To get around this issue I can just use my traversal algorithm. I have tested my traversal algorithm and know that it works hence I can just output the stack from traversing it. I will standardize my expressions before I create the trees since this is what will happen in the constructor later.
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{java}
//  create the standardized expressions
String a = standardize("2^x");
String b = standardize("(x+1)(x-1)");
// create the trees
BinaryTree treeA = createTree(a);
BinaryTree treeB = createTree(b);
// show the conversion between the expressions and trees
// the traverse function uses a stack so remember the output will be reversed
	// valid data
	// [2, x, ^] but it will be reversed therefore [^, x, 2]
	System.out.println(a + " -> " + treeA.traverse());
	// valid extreme data
	// [x, 1, +, x, 1, -, *] but it will be reversed therefore [*, -, 1, x, +, 1, x]
	System.out.println(b + " -> " + treeB.traverse());
\end{minted}
Here are the results:
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{console}
2^x -> [^], x, 2
(x+1)*(x-1) -> [*], -, 1, x, +, 1, x
\end{minted}
Which is exactly what I expected.

When I designed this algorithm I wrote about how I could implement it using multiple threads. While multi-threading can be very powerful, like everything in Computer Science there is a cost. This is especially true where in \texttt{Java} the cost of instantiating a thread\cite{threadCreationJava} (on the fly at least) is incredibly expensive. In the article it talks about three main things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Allocating Memory to the thread
\item Create the call stack for the thread\cite{threadStackJava, callStack}
\item Initialize and link the thread to the host OS
\end{enumerate}
This takes a lot of processing time, in this article\cite{threadCreationRate} one user manages to spawn about 10000 threads a second, which means that it takes approximately $0.1$ seconds to spawn every thread. This is to be taken with a pinch of salt however since the article is quite old (8 years in fact) and processors are better and the JVM should be more efficient nowadays than before. To test this for myself I ran their benchmark program.
\footnote{The code for this is on the StackOverflow thread, made by a user called, at the time of writing this, ``Jaan''\cite{threadCreationRate}} 
I did change some of the parameters to make each test do the same amount of work (the same number of instructions executed) and made the number of threads spawned different as well. I also ran it 3 times so I could calculate a mean to able to identify anomalous data. This also alleviates some of the randomness of the scheduler. I did this by compiling and executing the program 3 times, to reduce the effect of cached memory affecting the results. While the test does accommodate for this issue and allows for multiple tests, I think it is best to give the JVM no chance for optimization by just destroying and recreating the JVM. The results table and the corresponding graphs are below.

\noindent
From the analysis above it seems that the effect of using a few threads seems minimal and the overhead may be outweighed by the performance gain from using multithreading in other parts of the function. However this may be specific to this scenario, so to test this properly I implemented the multi-threaded version which is on the next page.

I then tried to test my 2 \texttt{createTree()} functions to identify if a purely single-threaded approach is more efficient than a multi-threaded approach. However the two approaches may change in effectiveness depending on the complexity of the expression we are parsing. In order to control this for a fair test we need to effectively measure the complexity hence we need to analyze the algorithm in detail.

Assuming that a single call of the \texttt{createTree()} algorithm takes the same time, $t$, to execute (exclude the recursive calls and the overhead that is need for them), then $\mathcal{O}(n) = n+1$ where $n$ is the number of operators. Assuming that the expression is valid, this value comes from the fact that we can split a standardized expression into by each operator. From the nature of our approach, there will be no operators on the start or the end of a valid expression, and each variable/constant is split apart by an operator\footnote{This is an inherent property within any valid expression since otherwise without this we cannot separate each variable/constant hence we cannot define explicitly where each variable/constant starts and ends. We have only applied this to operators and the idea becomes blurred when we include functions within our expression, such as trigonometric or logarithmic functions, but this does not matter since our algorithm does not currently does not deal with this.}. 
Now from this property we notice that each operator has a uniquely positioned variable/constant on the right of it, apart from the first operator which has an extra variable/constant to the left of it. Now our function recurses $k$ times where k is the number of base sub-expressions, i.e.\ variables/constants. However it can be hard to count these variables/constants since they can be of variable length (1.2 is a constant and has a length in terms of strings of 3, but $x$ is also a variable but has a length of 1). On the other hand operators are incredibly easy to spot and count since there is a finite number of types of operators, and they are all of length 1. Hence it makes sense to define the complexity of our function in terms of the number of operators. This means that one of our independent variables, the one we will change, will be the number of operators. We will also change whether we use threads or not since this is the point of our experiment. The code for the testing is below:

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{java}
// create the standardized expressions
String ex = standardize(""); //insert the expression to test in the speech marks
// create the trees
BinaryTree treeA, treeThreadA;
Instant start, end;
// run and time the threaded version
start = Instant.now();
treeThreadA = createTreeThread(ex); 
end = Instant.now();
System.out.println("time taken for threaded approach - " + Duration.between(start, end).toMillis() + "ms");
// run and time the sequential version
start = Instant.now();
treeA = createTree(ex);
end = Instant.now();
System.out.println("time taken for sequential approach - " + Duration.between(start, end).toMillis() + "ms");
\end{minted}
I will be testing expressions upto 1000 operators so I used the following code,\\ \mintinline[breaklines]{java}{new String(new char[n+1]).replace("\0", "x");}\cite{repeatCharJava}\\ where $n$ is the number of operators needed, to create the expressions automatically. For $n=5$ this creates the string \mintinline{java}{"xxxxxx"} and when it is standardized using the previous function it becomes \mintinline{java}{"x*x*x*x*x*x"},  which produces the expression needed to test. This relies on the fact that all the elements in arrays in \texttt{Java} are initialized as \mintinline{java}{null} and can all be replaced which is what is done.

When representing the data I collected in a scatter graph, I chose to use a logarithmic scale for the number of threads since the number of threads I used had a very large variation in value, ranging from 1 to 1000.\\
From analyzing the graph, it is clear that using threads took much more time than the normal sequential approach, in some cases over a 6000\% increase in time taken. However does this sort of relationship between a sequential and threaded approach continue for a larger number of operators?

Looking at the graph more closely it appears as though there is some kind of linear relationship between time and the logarithm of the number of operators (obviously ignoring the anomalous data at 100 operators). From using regression tools this relationship comes out as $T = 42.118\cdot \ln{n} + 67$\footnote{This has a PMCC of $r=0.9937$ so this is very good correlation}.

Similarly the relationship between the sequential version seems to be exponential on the graph so it is probably a linear relationship between time and the number of operators (not the logarithm this time). From using regression tools this relationship comes out as $T = 0.0178\cdot n + 0.1858$\footnote{This has a PMCC of $r=0.9993$ so this is very good correlation}.\\
Since a linear function increases quicker than a logarithmic one, if we find the point of intersection, we will find the theoretic point\footnote{It is important to realize that the sample size used here is small, but still legitimate so we can make careful extrapolations.} at which the threaded version outperforms, i.e.\ takes less time than, the sequential one. By using numerical method tools this comes out to be at $n\approx 28000$. Realistically we would never have this many operators in a simple function to sketch, however from a programming point of view, this is also ridiculous. From a call stack and memory point of view, this would require about 28000 recursive calls which not only is memory intensive and quite likely cause a stack overflow error\cite{recursionCallsJava}, it will consume even more memory if using threads. Just to test if it would cause a stack overflow I tried to an example with 28000 operators and I got the following output:
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{console}
Exception in thread "main" java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.StackOverflowError
	at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.report(FutureTask.java:122)

\end{minted}
It is therefore clear that using threads in this part of the program and quite possibly in other parts of the program where the number of threads required to spawn is high, is incredibly foolish and not worth the increased effort to implement.\\
