\section{Expressions}
My \texttt{Expression} class, the one I designed as \texttt{Function}, is quite a complex and large, therefore I will implement each method independently and test them before I use them within my other methods. The dependency graph for this is shown below:





\subsection{Standardize Expression}

\subsection{Check Brackets}

\subsection{Least Significant Operator}

\subsection{Create the Abstract Syntax Tree}

\subsection{Substitute}

\subsection{Evaluate}

\subsection{Constructor and Class as a Whole}
