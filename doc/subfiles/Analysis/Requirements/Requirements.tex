\chapter{Requirements}
From my research and analysis I have created a set of requirements that I aim to fulfill. I have split these requirements into development iterations that they will be linked with. Each iteration has a theme that most of the requirements will follow.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Iteration 1 - Emphasis on Core Functionality
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Plot a explicit function in $x$
			\item Plot multiple functions
			\item Zoom in/out of the graph
			\item Pan around the graph
		\end{itemize}
	\item Iteration 2 - Emphasis on the User
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Identify roots and turning points 
			\item Plot special functions such as trigonometric functions, logarithmics, modulus functions, etc.
			\item Multiple plots that you can switch between
			\item Save plots as pictures
			\item Save workspace to resume later
			\item \LaTeX \ equation support
			\item Dark Theme
		\end{itemize}
	\item Iteration 3 - Advanced Features
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Differentiate explicit continuous functions with respect to $x$
			\item Polar equations
			\item Implicit equations
			\item Parametric equations
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
